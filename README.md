# New Method, Dataset, and Evaluation Metric for Supervised Hierarchical Cross-Modal Hashing
## HIER Food-71 Dataset
There is a lack of benchmark datasets which involve multiple modalities and are hierarchically labeled and the exisiting hierarchically-labeled datasets focus only on the fashion domain and lack of real-world datasets. Quite naturally, food has rich hierarchical label information and the cross-media retrieval with hierarchical categories in food domain has the great demand In view of this,  we build a benchmark datasets named HIER Food-71 from food domain which contains 30,817 image-text instances labeled with a two-layer hierarchy. The dataset contains the following data:
* label.mat: Label matrix, 30817 * 71, 71 labels in total. Labels are divided into two layers, the 1-st to 5th labels represent cateogeries of the first layer while the 6-th to 71-th labels represent the catogeries of the second layer.
* ingredient.mat: Tag matrix, 30817 * 316, 316 ingredients in total,
* image224.mat: Image matrix, 30817 * 224 * 224 * 3,
* image227.mat: Image matrixï¼Œ30817 * 227 * 227 * 3,
* image_vgg.mat: The features extracted by VGG-F model, 30817 * 4096,
* image_alexnet.mat: The features extrated by Alexnet model, 30817 * 4096.
